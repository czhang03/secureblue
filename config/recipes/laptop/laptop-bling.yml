  # Installs laptop related changes from upstream
  # See the following for details:

  # **AMD 7040 series** user should consider avoiding bling `laptop` configuration at the moment.
  # This bling config will install TLP over PPD and apply several rules to save battery life.
  # However, TLP config will likely interfere with AMD suspend feature, 
  # hence PPD is typically recommended for **AMD 7040 series** users.
